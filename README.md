## Translate Entire Document
Translates all Text Layers and Symbol Overrides in the file that are on Artboards but skips them if placed inside a Symbol or outside an Artboard. I made this decision to avoid messing with the file structure.

Shortcut: `⇧` `⌘` `D` Translate Entire **D**ocument

## Set Google API Key...
To create a Google Translate API Key you need a paid account at [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com). 

There is also a Free Trial of $300 in credits which means, as long as you don't exceed that amount you won't have to pay anything. 

Be aware, both options require a Credit Card. [Check out their pricing](https://cloud.google.com/translate/pricing) to find out how many Language Detections and Translations you can get.

<strong>Too much hustle? See how to <a href="#use-without-api-key">Use without API Key</a></strong>
 
 
### 1. Create a new Project
